This makes scraping twitter for multiple search terms a piece of cake.

Just start a new Python scraper, and type this at the top:

@from scraperwiki import swimport
swimport('twitter_search').search(['some_phrase', 'from:some_user'])@

Set your scraper to run daily and it'll automatically fill its datastore with the latest tweets.
